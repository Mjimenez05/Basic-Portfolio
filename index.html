            <p>Hey guys, welcome to my page! My name is Matthew but everyone just calls me "Chef". I have been cooking for fourteen years professionally. I had been thinking that after all of this time it is all I've known for a career. So, I have chosen
                to begin a new career path in coding. Hopefully being able to get into the gaming industry. Where my passion really comes alive.
            </p>

            <p>I was born and raised in southern California. Always having pets and a love for the outdoors. I migrated to Utah with my family fifteen years ago. I am the last one here and stayed for the skiing! Currently, I have a dog named Tuna and a cat
                named Kona. They're thick as thieves together. </p>
